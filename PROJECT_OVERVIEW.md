# Project Overview: StreamHub

## Problem Statement
Users often face the inconvenience of switching between multiple streaming platforms to find and watch their favorite content. This leads to a fragmented viewing experience and difficulty in managing subscriptions.

## Solution
StreamHub aims to aggregate content from multiple streaming platforms into a single interface. Users can search, browse, and stream content from various platforms without switching apps. The app will leverage third-party APIs to fetch streaming availability and provide a seamless user experience.
